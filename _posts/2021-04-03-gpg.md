![mrkdwn-pass](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-passed-brightgreen.svg)
## Set everything up
- Linux Computer _(Windows or MacOS is compatible but you need to install GIT manually)_
- You need to install [Keybase](https://keybase.io), login or sign up one if you don't have.
- Your basic skill with __Git__ and __Github__:


_You need to know that Linux are have a default software: ```gpg``` for sign the GPG key. but we are going to use [Keybase](https://keybase.io) instead._


_This information if it contains**
```SOME_THING_IN_THIS_SENTENCE``` **in code block that means you can add everything you like. Some of words are not code, so please read carefully._ 

#### Check up Step
 - SSH keys have already setup.
 - Have some repositories cloned on your computer.

After installed Keybase -- Very first, you need to make sure everything is good by doing these commands:
```run_keybase```
For running Keybase, if you type ```keybase --version```, and it output __```keybase version 1.0.39-20180119172947+d29f565ed```__  then, type ```git --version ``` if it's show up like this __```git version 2.14.1```__ so everything is fine.

## Getting Started

Now, let's create the GPG key: type ``` keybase pgp gen``` fill up all the information related with or without your Github account. Type ```keybase pgp export > gpg.key```. Now your public key will be exported in __gpg.key__ file.
**_Please remember your e-mail_**

Login to your Github account in your browser:
Go to __Settings --> SSH and GPG keys --> New GPG key__

Open __gpg.key__ in text editor, copy all code (use ```ctrl+a``` for select all text) paste the code, click __New GPG key__

In this GPG keys, you will see __Key ID__. Copy this key.

Now open your __Terminal__. type and fill your copied key: ```git config --global user.signingkey __ADD_YOUR_KEY_HERE__```
and type this command: ``` git config --global user.email __YOU_REMEMBERED_E-EMAIL_THAT_YOU_HAD_GENERATED_```

##### DONE. Let's go the final step.

## Final Step

_Let's test, and see how it's worked._
